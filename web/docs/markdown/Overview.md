OneDB is an open source decentralized backend - it handles user authentication, data storage, and validation,
so **you can focus on creating a beautiful user interface**.

Anyone can host a OneDB instance, and end-users can decide where they want to store their data.
This means **end-users have complete control and ownership** over their data. And by utilizing
the existing network of OneDB instances, you can **deploy your app for free**, forever.

We provide a OneDB instance at `one-db.datafire.io` which is free for developers. End-users can
store up to 10MB of data before getting charged.

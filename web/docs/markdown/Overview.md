OneDB lets you create cloud-enabled apps without having to worry about or pay for backend
infrastructure.

OneDB is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service, similar to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
Anyone can host a OneDB instance, and end-users can decide where to store their data.
This means end-users have complete control and ownership over their data.

OneDB takes care of authentication, data validation,
and storage, so you can focus on building great user experiences. And by utilizing
the existing network of OneDB instances, you can deploy your app for free, forever.

We provide a OneDB instance at `one-db.datafire.io` which is free for developers. End-users can
store up to 10MB of data before getting charged.

# OneDB

OneDB lets you create cloud-enabled apps without having to worry about or pay for backend
infrastructure.

OneDB is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service, similar to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
Anyone can host a OneDB instance, and end-users can decide where to store their data.

This means end-users have complete control and ownership over their data, while developers can
create cloud-enabled applications for free.

We provide a OneDB instance at `one-db.datafire.io` which is free for developers. End-users can
store up to 10MB of data before getting charged.

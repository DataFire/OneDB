# OneDB

OneDB is a free, open source Backend-as-a-Service. You can use it to add a database and REST API
to any frontend application.

Anyone can host a OneDB instance, and you can allow your users to choose which instance they want to use.
This gives users complete control over where their data lives. The OneDB Data Explorer also allows them
to view, modify, and delete their data.

We provide a OneDB instance at alpha.freedb.datafire.io which is free for developers. End-users can
store up to 10MB of data before getting charged.
